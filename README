# Hard Hat Sites

A compojure application to list the Rails sites that are available
on the staging server.

## Usage

Visit: http://sites.hhdpreview.com.au

## Installation

0) Install the JVM and Clojure as per usual.
1) Install Leiningen: http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
2) Clone the repo
3) Install the dependencies with Leinengin:
   $ lein deps
4) Run it locally:
   $ java -cp "lib/*" clojure.main  src/sites_www/core.clj

On the server, I suggest running it behind a web server like Nginx
or Apache. Spin up Jetty as a daemon (sudo apt-get install daemon).

## To do

0) The app currently only assumes the correct domain names
   based on the name of the file. If someone manually changes
   the Nginx virtual host configuration and leaves the filename
   as-is, this app will never know.
